    """
    Applies a Savitzky-Golay filter to y with non-uniform spacing
    as defined in x

    This is based on https://dsp.stackexchange.com/questions/1676/savitzky-golay-smoothing-filter-for-not-equally-spaced-data
    The borders are interpolated like scipy.signal.savgol_filter would do

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like
        List of floats representing the x values of the data
    y : array_like
        List of floats representing the y values. Must have same length
        as x
    window : int (odd)
        Window length of datapoints. Must be odd and smaller than x
    polynom : int
        The order of polynom used. Must be smaller than the window size

    Returns
    -------
    np.array of float
        The smoothed y values
